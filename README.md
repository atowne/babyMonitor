## Open Source Baby Monitor

Goal: This application enables parents to watch their baby in real-time, see if they are awake or asleep, and to know exactly when their child went to bed.

# Why make this?
My son started to wake up in the middle of the night. He would play quietly in his crib for sometinmes as long as 45 minutes and then go back to sleep. He would be tired the next day, and we didn't know why.

# What does this applicaiton do?
This web application uses OpenCV to determine if a baby is awake or asleep. It also keeps a running log of each time the child wakes up and goes back to bed, enabling you to track your baby's movements.
